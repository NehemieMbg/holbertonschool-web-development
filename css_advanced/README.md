# General

This application is built using HTML and CSS. HTML is a markup language used to structure content on a web page, while CSS is a styling language used to customize the appearance of HTML elements.

# CSS

CSS can be added to an HTML element using the style attribute or by creating a separate CSS file and linking it to the HTML file using the <link> tag. CSS styles are defined using selectors and properties. A selector targets an HTML element and a property defines the style to be applied to the element.

A class is a way to apply a specific set of styles to one or more HTML elements. A class is defined in CSS using the .class-name notation, and is applied to an HTML element using the class attribute.

A selector is a pattern that targets one or more HTML elements for styling. Selectors can target elements based on their type, class, ID, or other attributes. CSS specificity value determines which style rule takes precedence when two or more rules target the same element.

Box properties in CSS are used to define the dimensions, borders, padding, and margins of an HTML element. These properties include width, height, border, padding, and margin.

# Webpage Loading

When a web page is loaded in a browser, the browser sends a request to the web server for the HTML file. Once the HTML file is received, the browser parses the document and sends additional requests for any CSS, JavaScript, or image files referenced in the HTML. The browser then downloads and executes each file in the order they are listed in the HTML file.

# Conclusion

The application showcases the ability to structure content with HTML and customize the appearance of HTML elements using CSS styles. The application was designed to be loaded by a web browser, which requests and downloads HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files to render the final web page.
