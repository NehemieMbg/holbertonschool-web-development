## HTML, advanced

In this project I learned the basics of HTML through this project, I can now create web pages using the standard markup language. I learned how to create an HTML page from a wireframe, which is a visual representation of a website's layout and structure.

I also gained an understanding of markup languages and how they are used to annotate text and define its structure. Through this project, I learned about the Document Object Model (DOM), which is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. This allowed me to understand how web pages are represented and how they can be manipulated through programming.

Additionally, I became familiar with important HTML concepts such as elements/tags and attributes, which are used to define the different types of content on a webpage and specify their properties such as size, color, and alignment.

Overall, this project provided me with a solid foundation in HTML and web development, and equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to create professional-looking web pages.
